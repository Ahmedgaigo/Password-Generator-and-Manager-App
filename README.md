The Password Manager is a Python application built using the Tkinter library. It provides a secure and convenient way to store and manage passwords for various websites and services. The application features a user-friendly interface and offers essential functionalities such as password generation, password saving, and password retrieval.

Features:

1. Save Password: The application allows you to enter the website, email/username, and password information. Upon clicking the "Add" button, the details are securely saved in a JSON file ("data.json"). The password is stored in an encrypted format to ensure data security.

2. Search Password: You can search for a saved password by entering the website name and clicking the "Search" button. If the website is found in the password database, the associated email and password details are displayed.

3. Password Generator: The application includes a password generator that creates strong and randomized passwords. Clicking the "Generate Password" button generates a password consisting of a combination of letters (lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and symbols. The generated password is automatically copied to the clipboard for easy use.

4. Data Storage: The password data is stored in a JSON file ("data.json"). If the file doesn't exist, it is created automatically. The data is organized by website name, with each entry containing the email and password information.

5. User Interface: The application's graphical user interface (GUI) features a clean design with labeled entry fields for website, email/username, and password. The interface also includes buttons for adding, searching, and generating passwords, providing a seamless user experience.

To use the Password Manager, run the script and interact with the provided interface. Enter the website, email/username, and password details to save a password.
